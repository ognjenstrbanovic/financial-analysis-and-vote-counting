# python-challenge
*The task for the first Python challenge was to create a script that analyzes the financial records (this data was given to us as a CSV file) of a fictional company and calculates: the total number of months in the dataset, net total amount of profit or losses over the entire period, average of the changes in profit or losses, date and amount of the greatest increase in profits, and date and amount of the greatest decrease in losses.*
*The second challenge's task was similar, just in a different context. Tasked to modernize a fictional town's vote-counting process via coding, we were given a much larger CSV file (of more than 3.5 million rows), and were asked to find: the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, percentage of votes each candidate won, total number of votes each candidate won, and winner of the election based on popular vote.*
*The analysis for both of these were printed to the terminal, and exported as a text document.*
